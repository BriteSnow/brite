# brite.js
brite.js is a simple but powerful DOM centric MVC (D-MVC) framework for building high-end HTML5 applications.
The driving concept is to just add the missing MVC pieces to the DOM rather than force fitting Desktop MVC
and Widget patterns to the DOM. The result is simpler, easier to optimize, and more scalable HTML/CSS/JS
application code. In short, brite turns the DOM (and jQuery) into a robust, efficient, and scalable MVC platform.

## Usage

`component.json`

    {
        …
        dependencies: {
            "BriteSnow/brite": "*"
            …
        }
        …
    }
