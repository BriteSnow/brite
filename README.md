# britejs Deprecation Notice

The documentation below is just for previous applications using britejs micro-library. **For new project, please checkout [dom-native](https://github.com/dom-native/dom-native)**, it's over 20x smaller as it has no jquery or any other dependencies (5kb compressed all included), fully embrace DOM Native Custom Element APIs (that are game changer for component model), and have simpler and more powerful APIs. britejs was a key inspiration for [dom-native](https://github.com/dom-native/dom-native), but given the new dom-native scope, a full rewrite was required.
